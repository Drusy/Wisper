Wisper
======

A particles inspired game for Android.

## About

#### Description
This project is aimed to get started with cocos2d-x framework, QML (QtQuick), the Kivy Python framework and the Android NDK using accelerometer, swipe gesture, etc.
As I am not a designer, I have choosen to work with particles to have a clean and fast visual result using gravity.

#### Game design
In this game, a wisper (a body separated soul) will have to find his body by travelling across the universe.
