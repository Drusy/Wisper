Wisper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Drusy/Wisper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Drusy/Wisper)

A particles inspired game for Android.

## About

#### Description

This project is aimed to get started with cocos2d-x framework, QML (QtQuick), the Kivy Python framework, libGDX using swipe gesture, etc.
As I am not a designer, I have choosen to work with particles to have a clean and fast visual result using gravity.

After some time testing all the game engines, I have choosen libGDX for the community, the pleasure of coding with, and the performances.

#### Game design

In this game, a wisper (a body separated soul) will have to find his body by travelling across the universe.
